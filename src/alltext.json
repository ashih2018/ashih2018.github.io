  "summary": "I am an incoming third-year student at the University of Toronto majoring in computer science and minoring in statistics and economics. Besides studying and coding, I love playing volleyball, attempting to cook, speedcubing, going on walks with my dog and playing piano. Oh, I'm also a huge board game addict. This past year I have spent over $500 on board games... My personal favorites are Catan, Quacks of Quedlinburg, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and Codenames (although admittedtly I'm terrible at Codenames).",
